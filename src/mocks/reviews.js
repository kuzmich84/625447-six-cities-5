    text: `Great stay. Adorable house. Comfortable, clean, private. Nice pool for relaxation and exercise, good proximity to freeways and other neighborhoods. 
  Close to kosher restaurants and grocery stores which was a bonus for us. Any concerns that arose were addressed. Would highly recommend this house.`,
